## Usage 

In the example below you will find a sample workflow how to set up a complete enterprise geodatabase. 

First you need create a new enterprise geodatabase and copy the data into it. Next step is to set permissions for roles and users. After that, feature classes and tables need to be registered as versioned. Lastly Geocom recommends to set up new spatial index values in order to keep high data performance. 


1. Create enterprise geodatabase (MSSQL).
2. Copy geodatabase to geodatabase.
3. Set permissions.
4. Register data as versioned.
5. Set spatial index geometry (MSSQL) or Set Spatial index sdebinary.

**IMPORTANT**: Always run the tools in exactly the same order.

> Some workflows are already predefined in the toolbox (see Toolgroup in folder *workflows*).
>
> You can create your own workflows and add them as a tool or use them as a standalone python script or batch-workflow.
